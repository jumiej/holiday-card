            <article class="text" >Hey <span id="userName" >there</span>,  I recognize that the months and days of 2022 have been extremely
                difficult for us, but I appreciate you traveling through the year with me.
                I am grateful for both our moments of weakness and strength as we navigated
                the good and bad days, especially all the shege's that have brought growth 
                our way. Jumie asks that we do this again next year.Cheers!!
